<h3>Love Today</h3>
<p>This movie was amazing as the story line was unique and the movie teaches many values</p>
<h3>12TH fail</h3>
<p>It was mind blowing. It showed the importance of sheer determination and hard work. The actor doesnt loses his hopes and keeps continuing which made him an IPS officer.</p>
<h3>Fighter</h3>
<p>This movie is based on Indian Airforce and the disputes between Pakistan. The dialouges were very catchy and deep. </p>
